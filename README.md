Background
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system that has been decided to be developed is be a web-based attendance system. 
It is developed for educational purposes.

Referring to some problems such as the difficulty of a lecturer to take attendance in a brief
period of time, lecturer might miss out some student’s name over enormous number of students
in a big class and students are difficult to track their attendance record. 

Therefore, the attendance system is decided to be developed to counter the issues. 
With the implementation of the system, attendance can be made by lecturer and marked by student faster and easily. 
The lecturer and students could manage the attendance records and details too.

The target users of the system will be student, lecturer, and admin. 
Each role of the systemholds different functionality/level of administration to the system.
